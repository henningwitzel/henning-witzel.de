            <p class="about">My team is part of the shaping and development process. We provide user research, design user flows, and build prototypes. When it comes to development, we are either embedded in an engineering team or offer UX-as-a-Service. Everything happens in close collaboration with product management, professional services, and customer success. As a designer, the user I'm focusing on is a store associate. To help them get the job done, we build store apps that enable mobile checkout, endless aisle, store fulfillment, real-time inventory, and clienteling.<p>

                  <p class="description">On a daily basis, we are working hands-on doing design jobs, user research, and prototyping efforts. When it comes to supporting development, we either embedded in an engineering team or offer UX-as-a-Service. </p>

                  <p class="description">Every designer at NewStore grew into a Product Manager role. The past year I was working on a white-label consumer app that our retailers could customize. Strategically we decided that this is currently not our focus and most significant challenge, so we chose to partner. </p>
                  <p class="description">Nevertheless, I gained a lot of knowledge designing a mobile app with the focus on shopping. Using that, I partnered up with another Product Manager, and together we lead the product design and development of the <a href="https://www.newstore.com/mobile-pos/">Associate App</a>. The app is a mobile POS solution that addresses the needs of today’s shoppers. It streamlines the checkout and gives store associates access to inventory & customer data. </p>

                  <p class="description">Joining NewStore was a big opportunity for me: Move to Berlin, work for an international B2B company, communicate in English, and grow my skill set as a designer.</p>
                  <p class="description">My first job was a pure designer role without any coding. In collaboration with a Product Owner and two engineers, we researched, prototyped, and developed the <a href="https://www.newstore.com/omnichannel-insights/">Omnichannel Manager</a>.  The primary user is the customer support of a retailer while also a retail manager, and NewStore support have a use for it.</p>
                  <p class="description">It was the first time I worked in a design team together with other designers and researchers. I learned a lot from Mathias <strike>Bartsch</strike> Kluge, who helped me shift my focus from design aesthetics to problem-centered design. We were always in close collaboration while everyone had the design ownership of a specific product: User Research, Design Reviews, Usability Tests, Design Sprints and working with engineers became our daily business.</p>

            <p class="about">Together with a team of computer scientists (Martin Gessert, Steven Lüttig & Kristof Friess), I founded an agency called <a href="http://www.zebresel.com">Zebresel</a> with a focus on website- and app development while we were still studying. From 2011 until 2015, we planned, developed, and launched customer projects in Germany. In addition to project management, I focused on the user experience and user interface design. At the end of 2013, we started to develop products based on our ideas.</p>

              <p class="date">November 2013 – March 2015 · 1.5 years</p>
              <p class="description">I loved doing design – it doesn't matter if it was a website, flyer, or an app. But it's not about how it looks like; it's how it feels. While still doing the design & development for customers, we also started building our products. I focused entirely on user experience design and user research. To my advantage, we always wanted to solve our own problems, and that made access to users and testing easier.</p>                            
              <p class="description top-medium"><b>Signum<sup>+</sup></b> – The first product is a digital signage solution. It allows you to manage content for every kind of screen. With the usage of social media, we enabled our customers to engage with their guests during events. Together with a display solution partner, we were able to show off the power of the product at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany 2014.

              <p class="description top-medium"><b>Beamerlasershow</b> – The second product is an app that allows you to create a light-show and fascinate your guests wherever you want. We combined a video projector, artificial fog, and 2D animations with an iOS device. The app for iPhone and iPad allows you to create playlists with a big set of predefined animations. By allowing to touch and draw animations on the screen, the live mix mode unfolded your creativity. Learn more about it here <a href="http://www.beamerlasershow.de">www.beamerlasershow.de</a></p>

              <p class="description">While it was clear to me that I want to get my master's degree, I was also already doing some business on the side. Together with colleagues from the university, I founded an agency called <a href="#zebresel">Zebresel</a>. By splitting my time between them, I learned how to apply my theoretical knowledge to solve customer problems and make money out of it.</p>
              <p class="description">At the university, I became better in analyzing complex requirements, propose appropriate solutions, plan, and coordinate implementations. I specialized in the development of complex interactive applications with a focus on user-centered design of interfaces.</p>

              <p class="description">Before I went to university, I worked as an IT engineer at <a href="https://www.jendata.com/">JENDATA Computersysteme GmbH</a>, and I was responsible for maintaining their customer's IT systems. In my day to day business, I dealt with computer hardware, software, and networking tools. I learned how to test, install, and configure those to troubleshoot them.</p>
