        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>I'm a 31 year old UX desginer that lives in Berlin.</h3>
        <p>My name is Henning, I'm the Head of Product Design at <a href="http://www.newstore.com">NewStore</a> with a background in computer since. I currently live and work in Berlin. 

        <p>I'm with the company since 2015, and I'm responsible for the user experience strategy and the design process of our applications. NewStore operates a platform for retailers to run their stores on iPhones.<p>

        <p>My team is part of the shaping and development process. We provide research, design user flows, and build prototypes. When it comes to development, we are embedded in an engineering team. Everything happens in close collaboration with product management, professional services, and engineering.<p>

        <p>The user I'm focusing on is a store associate. To help them get the job done, we build store apps that enable mobile checkout, endless aisle, store fulfillment, real-time inventory, and clienteling.<p>
