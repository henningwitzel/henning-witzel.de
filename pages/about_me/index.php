        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4 class="grey bottom-large">I'm a 32 year old Product Designer based in Berlin.</h4>        
        <p >My name is Henning, I'm a Product Designer with a background in engineering. For the past nine years, I've been designing & developing software products to provide meaningful and relevant user experiences.</p>
        <p> In 2011 I founded <a href="#zebresel">Zebresel</a>, a small agency in Erfurt (Germany), where I planned, designed, and implemented websites & web applications for our clients. After two years, we started developing our own products to solve problems in the event business. </p>
        <p class="bottom-medium">In 2015 I changed my life and went down a new path to experience other parts of the world. I joined <a href="#newstore">NewStore</a>, an international company that wants to bring the joy back to retail, and moved to Berlin. Since then, I'm part of the product team and transform the vision into a real product. Almost three years ago, I got the opportunity to build up a new design team and learn how to become a leader and manager. My team and I drive the UX strategy, scale the design process, and help others grow in design to deliver products people love.</p>

Being together with other designers and researchers helped me shift my focus from design aesthetics to problem-centered design. We were always in close collaboration, and each one of us had the design ownership of a specific product. Doing User Research, Story Mapping, Design Reviews, Usability Tests, Design Sprints, and working with Product Teams became my daily business.</p>

I founded the company with a team of computer scientists while I was still studying. From 2011 until 2015, we planned, developed, and launched customer projects in Germany.

              <p class="description">I loved doing visual design and building stuff – it didn't matter if it was a website, flyer, or an app. But it's not about how it looks like; it's how it feels and the journey within. While still doing design & development for our customers, we also started building our products. I focused more on user experience design and marketing and less on coding. To my advantage, for both products, we were trying to scratch our own itch and solved problems that we had inside the event business.</p>
