          <h5 class="grey bottom-medium">Book by Simon Sinek · 2011</h5>
          <p><i>Start with Why</i> is one of the most useful and inspiring books I have read recently. It starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? </p>
          <p>People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people wouldn't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it.</p>
          <p>I started to learn seeing things from a different perspective by using his framework: the Golden Circle. He states that upon this, organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired - it all starts with WHY. Just recently, I held a presentation about user testing in my company. Before I began to show the results, I started with WHY we actually did user testing and moved then on to the HOW (the methods we used) and the WHAT (the results).</p>

          <h5 class="grey bottom-medium">Book by L. David Marquet · 2020</h5>
          <p>Your words matter more than you think</p>
          <p>Most of us use the language we inherited from a time when workers worked with their hands and managers worked with their heads. Today, your people do much more than simply follow orders. They contribute to performance and solve problems, and it's time we updated our language to reflect that.</p>
          <p>In Leadership Is Language, former US Navy captain L. David Marquet offers a radical playbook to empower your people and put your team on a path to continuous improvement. The framework will help you achieve the right balance between deliberation and action, and take bold risks without endangering your mission. Among other things, you'll learn: How to avoid the seven common sins of questioning, from binary questions (should we do A or B?) to self-affirming questions (B is the better option, right?) Why you should vote first, then discuss, when deciding on a plan with your team, rather than voting after discussion. Why it's better to give your people information instead of instructions?</p>

          <h5 class="grey bottom-medium">Book by L. David Marquet · 2013</h5>
          <p>I used to compare working in a software company like being on a ship. Everyone on board needs to know where we are heading. Each team has responsibility for a specific area and, at the same time, requires to function with others – it doesn't matter if you control the engines or work the kitchen.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we get feedback that the ship is not fast enough. Sometimes people try to take a motorboat to go ahead while ending up coming back at some point. Who is making strategic decisions? Who is actually on the steering wheel? Is it one person that determines everything, and do we all have to follow? When I found this book, I was curious about the story of how David Marquet and 134 others overcame their challenges by actually being together on a submarine.</p>          
          <p>Turn the Ship Around! is the true story of how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the U.S. Navy's traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control.</p>

          <p>Talking to customers is one of the foundational skills of both Customer Development and Lean Startup.

But we still end up building stuff nobody buys or uses. </p><p>Learning how to ask the "right" questions to ascertain whether there is real customer pain is key. This book is going to show you how customer conversations go wrong and how you can do better.</p>

          <h5 class="grey bottom-medium">Book by Mark Manson · 2016</h5>
          <p>Mark Manson's book influenced some of my core philosophies and values. He says that there are only so many things we can give a fuck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter. Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given.</p>
          <p class="bottom-large"><i>What stuck with me</i> is that you shouldn't base your happiness on values that are superstitious, socially destructive, and not controllable. Relying on external events that are outside of your control doesn't make you happy. Real-life stories like the one from Dave Mustaine or Pete Best make a good point. Base your values on things like honesty, self-respect, curiosity, or standing up for oneself and others. They can be achieved internally and opens your mind in a certain way to experience it.</p>

          <h5 class="grey bottom-small">Book by by Amy Wallace and Edwin Catmull · 2014</h5>
          <p>I’m a big fan of Pixar, and I’ve always wondered how they been able to create so many fantastic movies over the years? Movies like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, WALL-E, Cars, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille. In this book, Ed answers the question, and you can learn about their growth and how they found a way to manage creativity. For me, it’s a must-read for product designers, managers, and artists that want to invent and create new products.</p>
          <p class="bottom-large"><i>What stuck with me</i> is the concept of the Braintrust. To achieve a certain level of honesty, they created a group of trusted colleagues that review the progress of a film that is in development. It’s an environment where honesty is possible; directors and creative teams can give and receive direct and constructive feedback to each other. According to Ed, the job of the Braintrust is to <i>“push towards excellence, and root out mediocrity.”</i> If I made you curious here two articles that go more into detail. The first one talks about <a href="https://medium.com/great-business-stories/lessons-from-pixar-1-the-braintrust-e306843a5153" target="_blank">lessons you can learn </a> from the Braintrust and second one about <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/pixars-braintrust-why-it-is-important-for-a-creative-culture-7dcbee3aa8f5" target="_blank">why it’s important</a> for a creative culture.</p>
