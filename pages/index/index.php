        <h1>Hi, I'm Henning.</h1>
        <h4 class="grey bottom-large">I design and build software products to solve problems.</h4>
        <p>Hey – it looks like you made it here! There are different reasons for this: maybe you know me, or you found me somehow on the internet – either way, I'm welcoming you.</p>
        <p>The internet became a place where companies and their algorithms control a lot of information. You need to hope that the post you saw on Instagram or Facebook will pop up again. Or a new article at Medium you want to read is not accessible because you reached your limit for the month.</p>
        <p>This site is my attempt for an independent place of all my thoughts and projects. You can read my <a href="###basepath###blog">articles</a>. See what kind of <a href="###basepath###books">books</a> or <a href="###basepath###podcasts">podcasts</a> I like. Take a look at specific projects I worked on and, of course, learn something <a href="###basepath###about_me">about me</a> — no limitations, no algorithms, no advertisments, just a simple website.</p>
        <p>The site is still work in progress. The last update was on <span class="grey">December 27th, 2019</span>.</p>
