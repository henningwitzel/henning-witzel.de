          <h3><a href="###basepath######page###/feedback">Capturing User Feedback – One thing people do when an app doesn’t seem to work </a></h3>
          <h5 class="grey bottom-small">August 2nd, 2020 · 5 min read</h5> 
          <p>Do you struggle to know what is going on when something went wrong within your app? Do you get feedback from your users about an issue, but it's hard to figure out what happened exactly? I'm not talking about crashes – more like a white screen, getting stuck, or something did not load.</p>
      <p>If you can answer one of these with yes, I might have something interesting for you. In this article, I share the learnings on how we managed to develop an effective way of capturing user feedback when something went wrong.</p>

            <h3><a href="###basepath######page###/gif">Sharing Interactions – How I create GIFs with LICEcap</a></h3>
            <h5 class="grey bottom-small">May 15th, 2020 · 2 min read</h5> 
            <p>As a designer, there are often moments where I designed a user flow and created a prototype to indicate a specific interaction I had in mind. The next step is usually to share it with a product owner, developer, or put it into a document to describe the flow.</p>
            <p>The easiest way for me to do this is to capture my desktop and create a GIF or video. As an example you can see below how Grammarly helped me to correct and improve this text. The GIF shows how the interaction works, and I do not depend on you to click a play button – it will catch your attention.</p>

            <h5 class="grey bottom-small">February 2nd, 2020 · 3:50 min read</h5> 
            <p>Actually, this should have been the first article in my blog explaining what happened to my website. In the last five years, I had many attempts for a redesign or even getting rid of it but never found the motivation – that changed at the end of last year.</p>
            <p>Since 2008 I have that domain, and it was always full of pictures.  For many years photography was my hobby, and the website was an easy way of showing my photos. It also helped me to make some money on the side by attracting new customers, in my case, couples who wanted to get married.</p>

            <h5 class="grey bottom-small">January 5th, 2020 · 4 min read</h5> 
            <p>When I joined <a href="###basepath###/about_me#newstore">NewStore five years ago</a>, I had no idea what it means to have a calendar that feels like a school timetable or an inbox with 200 unread emails overnight. Chat tools like Slack made it possible for everybody to reach out to me and interrupt whenever they think it's necessary. In the beginning, I thought I need to be responsive to everybody not to seem rude or unproductive – but actually, I started to feel and became unproductive.</p>
            <p>You go into the office in the morning and join one meeting after another. During the breaks and even during the meetings, you are checking Slack. And of course, your email inbox pops up every now and then to inform you about something that happened in Jira. It was time for a change.</p>

        <h5 class="grey bottom-small">November 27th, 2019 · 3 min read</h5>
        <p>A month ago, I listened to the latest episode of the <a href="https://rework.fm/this-time-its-personal/">podcast about Basecamp Personal</a>, and I wanted to share how I introduced Basecamp at NewStore. I was one of the people who used the free version of the time they experimented with it. </p>
      <p>What is <a href="https://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>? A simple project collaboration tool that helps people make progress together sold on a monthly subscription.</p>
      <p>After reading "Shape Up" I tried out the <i>30-day</i> trial version with my girlfriend. We liked how easy it was to manage projects and don't lose oversight. After the period ended, we discussed if we should extend the trial or spend the $99 every month. Not using it was out of the picture.</p>

        <h3>Beyond The UX Tipping Point</h3>
        <h5 class="grey bottom-small">November 27th, 2019</h5>
        <p>For the longest time, making a great experience for the user was a business-strategy luxury item. A great product only had to work and ship. A great experience was a nice-to-have, not a requirement. Times have changed.</p>
